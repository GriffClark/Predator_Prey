TODO:

1) ArrayLists<> need to be cleaned up. Singleton format must be strictly followed to ensure that bugs do not persist in the program
2) Grid needs to be cleaned up so that MVC is strictly followed. Make it very obvious why each method or data type is part of the model, view, or controller. This will improve readability and reduce bugs
3) Build Animal.doThings() along with reproduce methods
4) Build View class
5) Structure the model so that things can start happening. This will require a basic ASCII representation to see how things are working
6) Figure out how multi-threading will work to make sure that things happen as efficinetly as possible


		Notes to self


things to look into:
* more effective search algorithims
*do actors need unique ID
* 
NEED TO DO:
didnt think through colisions. No 2 algae can be in same spot but a shark can be on an algae spot, right? 

Right now no easy way to access records build GameMethod that allows pulling of most recent record
